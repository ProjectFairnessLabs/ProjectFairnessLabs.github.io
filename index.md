## Welcome to The Project Fairness Labs

Welcome to our [Labs](https://github.com/ProjectFairnessLabs)! We didn't expect you to find us so easily, but rest assured, we do work on the FiveM server as well.

This is more of... a developer's grounds, so any server owner can use some of our tools (must give us credit, of course), and fork projects to fix them.

### Intent

The intentions for **The Project Fairness Labs** is to make, fix and modify some of the best plugins and tools for our FiveM crowd, as well as other people for many other games that might use them.
