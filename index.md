# Welcome to The Project Fairness Labs

Welcome to our [Labs](https://github.com/ProjectFairnessLabs)! We didn't expect you to find us so easily, but rest assured, we do work on the FiveM server as well.
This is more of... a developer's grounds, so any server owner can use some of our tools (must give us credit, of course), and fork projects to fix them.
We also have some fun, too. Why not join us?

## Intentions

The intentions for **The Project Fairness Labs** is to make, fix and modify some of the best plugins and tools for our FiveM crowd, as well as other people for many other games that might use them.
We are very glad you guys can follow our projects, and we are glad we are working hard to provide the best of the best for you all.
